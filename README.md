# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jiya Kamdar!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **B.Tech Computer Science student** at **VIT Bhopal** with a passion for crafting creative solutions through **design** and **code**.

âœ¨ My journey in tech began with an innate curiosity about how websites come to life. Over time, this evolved into a deep love for **designing, painting, and crafting websites** that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

When I'm not immersed in coding or designing, you'll probably find me expressing myself through **dance**, my favorite hobby that keeps me balanced and inspired.

## ðŸŒŸ What I'm passionate about:
- **Web Development**: Crafting seamless user experiences with clean, beautiful code.
- **Design**: Bringing imagination to life with creative and functional interfaces.
- **Learning**: Constantly exploring new technologies and improving my craft.

## ðŸŒ® Fun fact:
I love combining creativity with structure, whether that's through **coding, crafting, or dancing**. And yes, every now and then, I daydream about all the amazing projects waiting to be built!
